# Hololive Suika Fan Game

I decided to learn Rust and saw the Suika Game boom in popularity within Hololive. I figured why not make a version with Hololive characters.

Rust comes with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) (game engine) and [Rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier) (physics engine), so much of this was fairly simple.

The game is very minimal, with no music/sound and very minimal (and ugly) UI. The game logic may also be buggy.

I may come back to fix bugs and/or make other improvements.

I will commit to making improvements if someone wishes to help out in the art/design aspects.

# Legal stuff?

I have no idea how necessary this is, but I don't own any assets used in this game. They belong to Cover Corp.

# Special thanks

In assets, I have kept an shoddily cropped yagoo.png file. He accompanied me throughout most of the dev process.
