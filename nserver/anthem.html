National Anthem of the Elite Forces : Defenders in shadows

Unbreakable Union of freeborn Republics,
Great Forces has welded forever to stand.
Created in struggle by will of the people,
United and mighty, our Essism land!

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Essism is her creed, a shield
Peace the prize, but strength at the core.
With blade and skill, with heart and will,
To Essism's triumph lead us on!

Through tempests the sunrays of freedom have cheered us,
Along the new path where great leaders did lead.
To a righteous cause he raised up the peoples,
Inspired them to labour and valourous deed.

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Essism is her creed, a shield
Peace the prize, but strength at the core.
With blade and skill, with heart and will,
To Essism's triumph lead us on!


In the victory of Essism's ideal,
We see the future of our dear land.
And to her fluttering sapphire banner,
Selflessly true we always shall stand!

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Essism is her creed, a shield
Peace the prize, but strength at the core.
With blade and skill, with heart and will,
To Essism's triumph lead us on!
